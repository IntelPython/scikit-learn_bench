L-BFGS-B
========

This directory contains version 3.0 of L-BFGS-B in Fortran, available
at http://users.iems.northwestern.edu/~nocedal/lbfgsb.html
under the terms of the BSD license. Fortran files `lbfgsb.f`, `linpack.f`,
and `timer.f` come from this library.

`lbfgsb.h` contains a C header to call the Fortran setulb_ routine.
`lbfgsb_daal.h` contains a DAAL class wrapping the L-BFGS-B library for use
as a DAAL iterative solver.

The authors of the library ask that we quote at least one of the references
below.
